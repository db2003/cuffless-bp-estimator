This project is focused on leveraging the advances in deep learning to revolutionize blood pressure monitoring. We aim to develop a deep learning model that can accurately and continuously detect blood pressure using physiological signals such as Photoplethysmogram (PPG) and Electrocardiogram (ECG).
